This is a project for course COEN 6311 Software Engineering. A marketplace is an area where people meet to sell or buy products. The prime idea of an online marketplace is to provide a virtual interface for users to interact with each other regarding a product. For using the application to buy or sell a product, users must register themselves. Registered users will be able to post an Ad, view newly posted Ads, view the product catalogue, sort the items in a category according to the listed price and location, chat with the seller regarding product. Users can also specify the product and location to get notified about new Ads posted in that location.
